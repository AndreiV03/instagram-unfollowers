# Instagram Unfollowers

The easiest way to check who hasn't followed you back on Instagram is to do it manually, keeping track of the exact number of followers. If you notice your followers count goes down, you can investigate the "Following" lists of those specific users to verify whether or not they're still following you.

This is obviously very time-consuming and impractical work â€” especially when you have a lot of followers who fluctuate regularly. From now you can use this script to check who hasn't followed you back!

## Usage

1. Sign in to your Instagram account on your browser.
2. Open browser's console / devtools by pressing F12 on your keyboard.
3. Copy this script:

```js

```

4. Paste the script on to the console and wait for the process to finish.
